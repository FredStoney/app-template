# Cursor commands

Custom commands are **Markdown files** in this directory. In Cursor chat or the agent input, type **`/`** to see and run them.

- **Project commands** (here): shared with the repo, good for team workflows.
- **Global commands**: `~/.cursor/commands/` on your machine for personal shortcuts.

Each `.md` file’s content is the prompt Cursor runs when you invoke that command. Name files clearly (e.g. `code-review.md`, `add-tests.md`).
