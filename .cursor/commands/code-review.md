# Code review

Review the current file or selected code for:

1. **Correctness** – Logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one, null/undefined handling.
2. **Style & consistency** – Naming, formatting, and patterns used elsewhere in the project.
3. **Security** – Input validation, injection risks, sensitive data exposure.
4. **Performance** – Unnecessary work, N+1 queries, missing caching.
5. **Maintainability** – Readability, duplication, unclear abstractions.

Suggest concrete edits (with code snippets where helpful). Prioritize high-impact issues first.
