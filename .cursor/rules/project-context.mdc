# Project context

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless the task explicitly requires new modules or components.
- Follow existing patterns and style in the codebase.
- Use the project's dependency manager and versions (see package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) when adding dependencies.
- Prefer minimal, focused changes; avoid unnecessary refactors unless asked.
